        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>This website is a guide on the main four Robins! Batman has had many partners over the years, and together they make a vigilante family. If you didn't realize there was more than one Robin, this is the right place! Each Robin will get their own page, giving brief sections on backstory, history, and skills. Many have new identities, which will also be covered. Because there's a lot of media with many different authors, I've chosen to include what I think is most in character and realistic, and I've included the timelines that make the most sense. Due to time constriants, only 4 memebers of the "Bat Family" will be covered, but the Wayne Family also includes Alfred, Bruce, Cass, Duke, Stephanie, and more. If this website sparks your interest, check them out!</p>
